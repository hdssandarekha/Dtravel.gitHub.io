Standing at 452 meters, Petronas Towers broke the record of 442 meters held by Sears Tower in Chicago, which had been holding the title of World's Tallest Building for 25 years since 1974. The twin towers are topped by two spires, or known as pinnacles, a common feature of Islamic architecture. The highest occupied floor is 88th floor at 375 meters high.<br>

The twin towers remained the tallest building in the world for 6 years, until in 2004 when Taipei 101 surpassed them. However as of today they are still the tallest twin towers in the world, and may remain that for at least another 5 years or 10 years, or even longer, no one knows when they will be surpassed by other structures, as currently there's still no a proposal for higher twin towers proposed and approved, let alone being built. Dubai used to proposed a project that aimed to become the tallest twin towers in the world, but that proposal had been replaced by the Dubai Creek Tower, which is designed to be built to 1300 meters by 2020.<br>
